Venus has officially moved out of Aries and into Taurus, one of the signs where Venus is most comfortable. Most of us will experience this as a change of pace from the frenzied activity of the last month, letting us step back and re-ground so we can learn exactly what in our lives is most deserving of our time and attention. 

Venus' last couple weeks in Aries has been marked by a particularly intense Gemini period. The airiness of Gemini combined with the fire of Aries can result in an explosion of activity -- a moment of potent expansion that quickly dissipates into smoke if it doesn't find a clear direction. New ideas and opportunities may have appeared in your life, accompanied by a sense of urgency to act on them immediately. This can result in feeling pulled in multiple directions at once, encouraging us to spread ourselves thin. 

We can only do so much at once; our time and capacity is finite. Venus in Taurus gives us space to tune into what we really value, and grasp the things that truly bring beauty and abundance into our lives. 

Give yourself space to breathe and really sit with what's possible. Feel into the somatic experience that arises when considering what each opportunity might demand from you and what you stand to gain. How might this change your world and the worlds of those you love? What does each sensation have to tell you?

Over the next month, give everything the space it needs to clarify. Be open to the experience of beauty to be found in each corner of your world, and listen to what it has to tell you. Really feel into what is and is not serving you.

In letting everything become clear, the bull can begin to carry you forward on your path, building the momentum to realize what you really want, one sure step at a time.

	<AccordionItem title="Aries ♈︎">
		Venus is moving from your first house of self-definition to your second house of personal resources making this a fortunate time to pursue new avenues for bringing abundance into your life. New opportunities for your self-development or advancement may have emerged over the course of March and May, accompanied by a sense of urgency to act on them. Now its time to take stock of your options and determine what truly deserves your time and commitment. 

		Remember that resources may be more than just financial, they may be social, emotional, bodily. Take your time to sit and breathe with each new pathway, notice the sensations in your body as they relate to your wants and needs. What do they have to tell you? Taking the time to listen to your body will reveal the path of your highest flourishing. Resist the urge to rush, knowing that wherever you let your feet take you will give you what you need most.

	<AccordionItem title="Taurus ♉︎">
		Venus is moving from your twelfth house, the place of hidden wounds, to your first house, the place that most closely defines your self. The twelfth often represents things that subtly work against you -- they may be generational patterns, childhood wounds, repressed feelings, self-sabotaging behaviours, or people that undermine your best interests without you noticing. Regardless of its particular manifestation, topics in the twelfth only become clear when [we slow down and tend to them with patience and kindness.](https://www.alicesparklykat.com/articles/297/The_Twelfth_House/) Venus in Aries might manifest for you as a drive for pleasure, speed, or action that keeps you from noticing those things that undermine you.
		
		Venus' movement into your first house encourages you to move slower and really grasp the things that have been working against you. Pursuits that stimulate your healing and self-growth will be particularly fortunate, as will any work done to clamp down on self-limiting patterns. Treat yourself with the patience and kindness that we all deserve -- these topics are difficult and frustrating by nature and struggle is a crucial part of overcoming them.

	<AccordionItem title="Gemini ♊︎">
		Venus is moving from your eleventh house of friendships, alliances, and community to your twelfth house, the place of hidden wounds. March and May might have been somewhat intense within your social life, perhaps you've fallen out with some old friends or jumped into new friend groups. In general you might be feeling the need to bring new connections and community into your life. This may have been accompanied by significant new opportunities for your self-growth and development that appeared in the second half of May. As Venus moves into Taurus, the sense of urgency that has been present in the last couple months should fade. It is time to slow down and take stock of how you can make the most out of the events of the past few months, so you can truly embrace the opportunities that lay before you.

		The twelfth house often represents the things that subtly work against you -- they may be generational patterns, childhood wounds, repressed feelings, self-sabotaging behaviours, unstable boundaries, or people that undermine your best interests without you noticing. Venus moving into your twelfth house represents a fortunate time for you to gently explore these themes as they are relevant to you -- any shadow work you do in this period will bear fruit. Work towards establishing new healthier patterns of relation, let new boundaries and ways of seeing begin to take shape, even if they won't be fully grown for quite a while. It is particularly important to work with your somatic experience at this time. Slow down and really let yourself feel into the things that have been influencing you beneath the surface. What sensations do you notice? What do they have to tell you? 

		Make sure you seek support as you work through difficult feelings such as shame or guilt, but be sure not to run away from them. Their resolution can only come through confronting them with compassion and self-understanding -- extend yourself the kindness that you genuinely deserve, as difficult as that might be. As you move through the next month you may find internal limitations beginning to loosen their grasp on you, opening up space for you to truly flourish.

	<AccordionItem title="Cancer ♋︎">
		Venus is moving from your tenth house of purpose, career, and public perception to your eleventh house of friendships, alliances, and community. The last month may have been a bit frantic for you -- perhaps you've been pushing to make what you do with your time meaningful, or have been searching for an opportunity to advance your work goals and reputation. With Saturn having moved into Aries a couple weeks ago, it is likely that you've brushed against some of the limitations that have kept you from fully taking advantage of those opportunities. 

		Aries is a highly independent sign, it prompts us to do our own thing and go it alone. However, Venus' movement into Taurus means that a shift of focus towards interdependence will serve you well. Remember that you are not alone, and that we are all strongest when we're supported by our friends, communities, and social networks. Take some time to enjoy the simple pleasures of reconnecting with close friends and participating in community. Your connections may shine new light on your path, illuminating the next steps to getting what you really want.

	<AccordionItem title="Leo ♌︎">
		Venus is moving from your ninth house of journeys, spirituality, and philosophy to your tenth house of purpose, career, and public perception. February through May might have been marked by endings and a need for transformation, leading you to search for new pathways and perspectives to begin a new chapter. Now, as Venus moves out of Taurus, that period of searching is coming to a close. 

		It's time to let the lessons you've been integrating begin to guide your external life. How does what you've learned over the past few months shed light on what you feel your purpose to be? This is an ideal time to feel into your body as you begin to walk new paths. Notice what your somatic experience has to tell you; are you making all the changes necessary to promote your flourishing? Remember, there is no need to rush into anything right now -- this is a time for taking the first steps of a new journey and figuring out if that journey is right for you. Trust yourself and you will find that your body leads your feet in the direction you are supposed to go. 
	</AccordionItem>

	<AccordionItem title="Virgo ♍︎">
		Venus is moving from your eighth house of transformation, endings, fatigue, and inheritance to your ninth house of journeys, spirituality, and philosophy. Venus' movement through your eighth house in March and May might have coincided with sudden endings, mounting frustrations, or feelings of grief, highlighting a need for transformation and new beginnings in those areas of your life. Venus' movement into Taurus signals a slowing down of the intensity of the last few months, giving you space to breathe and reorient yourself. 

		Reorientation involves taking a deeper look at the situation we find ourselves in, which is most successful when we adopt new perspectives, revealing pathways that were previously hidden to us. Take time to learn from those with worldviews you have not explored, new resonances and ways of seeing might emerge, leading to changes in your path that would otherwise be impossible. This will also be a fortunate time to travel -- having some distance from your circumstances and being immersed in different rhythms and ways of living can effect positive changes. 

		As your perspective widens, take the time to feel deeply into your body. There is no need to rush to adopt a new belief system whole cloth, let your somatic experience indicate what to take with you and what to leave behind.

	<AccordionItem title="Libra ♎︎">
		Venus is moving from your seventh house of partnership to your eighth house transformation, endings, fatigue, and inheritance. Your last month may have been explosive, sparks of passion or frustration may have been flying in relationships old and new. While partnerships are often romantic, the seventh house also rules over business partners, mentors, and other in-depth one-on-one relationships. Venus' movement into Taurus asks you to slow down and feel into recent events in this area of your life. If new opportunities have emerged, what kind of life changes are necessary to act on them? If areas of a partnership are feeling stagnant, what needs to change?

		There is no need to rush through transformation -- you will benefit from taking things one step at a time, staying grounded in your somatic experience. Trust in the wisdom of your body as you assess the possibilities before you, it will guide you to the most fortunate outcome. If a relationship isn't working, don't immediately throw it away. Making change in your relationships can be a matter of shifting perspective, behaviour, and routine; it may be difficult, but if both partners are down to put in the work then the relationship can evolve into something new and beautiful. 

		Big changes in an already existing relationship may bring out feelings of grief, anxiety, and fear. These are natural indications that you care about the other person, and staying with these feelings is necessary to work with and resolve them. Try to engage with them constructively -- you don't need to overwhelm yourself and be washed away by the intensity of your feelings, but its very important not to ignore them altogether. Be with yourself and your partners, staying with the changes in the knowledge that calmer waters are waiting on the other side.

	<AccordionItem title="Scorpio ♏︎">
		Venus is moving from your sixth house of routine, daily life, and daily struggles, to your seventh house of partnership, which includes romantic partners, business partners, and mentors. The last month may have been a bit chaotic for the structure of your daily life, you may have been feeling frustrated with your current structure and have jumped into sudden changes. You may also have been feeling a greater need for independence and avoiding compromise. Saturn's entrance into Aries might mean that that frustration will hang around until you can find new structures that work.

		Venus' movement into Taurus is bringing a very fortunate period for you to find new partners or ground yourself in existing partnerships. Consider how your routines are influenced by your partners, and whether those structures are currently serving you or need to be adjusted. Take some time to feel into the bodily sensations that you notice when you are with your partners. What do they have to tell you? Is this whats right for you right now, or might this be time for a change? 

		Regardless, this next month has the potential to be highly fruitful in connecting with your partners. Savor pleasures with your lover, deepen your plans with your business partner, or dig deeper with your mentor. You might be surprised by the new things you discover there and the changes they bring about in your daily life.

	<AccordionItem title="Sagittarius ♐︎">
		Over the last month, Venus has been moving through your fifth house of pleasure, play, and creativity. This may have manifested as a particularly creative and fun period for you, though the intensity of Venus in Aries can amplify that energy into overindulgence. Saturn's entrance into Aries may be beginning to show you the need for creative structure and play to be integrated into the broader structure of your life. 

		Venus has now moved into Taurus in your sixth house of routine, daily life, and daily struggles, making this a perfect time to solidify sparks of play and creativity into your daily life. This is a fortunate time to begin feeling into your daily rhythms, noticing what serves you and what doesn't. Does your routine make space for play and pleasure that supports your well-being? If not, look for spaces that are malleable such as wind-down time in the evening, and consider how a change in activity or structure can bring more creative play into that time. 

		Its also worth considering how the spaces you frequent influence your ability to play! Are you around people that have similar interests, or that want to engage in creative play? Making changes here could be as simple as beginning to host a regular dinner + art sesh at your house, or beginning to frequent spaces clustered around your areas of interest. Take this opportunity to savor newfound pleasures, and create the conditions that will let your pleasures grow moving forward.

	<AccordionItem title="Capricorn ♑︎">
		With Aries in your fourth house of home, roots, and private life, the last month may have brought out an intense need for control and independence within your own space. This may have been a time where you have felt the need to make deep changes in your personal life, perhaps taking shape in new boundaries and a need not to compromise. As this period draws to a close and Saturn enters Aries, you may feel like the space you've carved out for yourself is established and solidifying, freeing up energy to go in a new direction.

		The last month may have brought to you a pressing need for change or renewed depth in your third house, which represents your local spaces, communication, and extended family. Perhaps you have felt the need to explore a new neighbourhood and an impulse to quickly move. Perhaps you have been frustrated by a lack of depth with members of your family (chosen or otherwise), or have been pleasantly surprised if your push for understanding was received well. You may have been feeling an urgent need to be understood, to have your community know where you're at in life and what you need to be supported. Saturn has likely made its presence felt in this area -- you may be feeling the limits of what those third house topics can bring you right now. 

		As Venus moves into your fourth house of home, roots, and private life, it is time to shift your attention inward. Take time to really be with yourself and your personal space -- feel into your body with the intention of building the internal structures that will support your external living. If you have been wrestling with the feeling of being unsettled, this will be a fortunate time for you to tend to your living situation and feel into any changes that need to be made. This will also be a potent time should you choose to engage connect with lineage and ancestors. Remember that our experiences resonate with those that came before us, and we can all benefit from the wisdom and guidance of our guardian spirits.

	<AccordionItem title="Pisces ♓︎"> 
		Over the last month, Venus has been transiting your second house of personal resources, the: financial, emotional, physical, and energetic reserves that support your flourishing. Venus' presence here may have highlighted an underlying need that is not being met, or may have brought about a sudden and intense opportunity to feel strong and resourced in an area that is lacking. However, Saturn's entrance into Aries might be bringing up feelings of restlessness and restriction, you may feel a need to abandon the old in your search for new sources of support. 
 
 		Although it may be tempting to throw caution to the wind, you will be better served by moving slowly, and really feeling into each new option that presents itself to you. Venus has entered into Taurus in your third house of local spaces, communication, and extended family (chosen or otherwise). Take some time to feel into how each topic currently feels in your body, notice each sensation and what it has to tell you. Grounding yourself in a particular neighbourhood or locale may bear fruit, bringing new opportunities for connection and support. Feel into how you have been communicating lately, and the way others have been communicating with you. Have things felt clear or muddled? Are the patterns of communication you are caught in easing or building feelings of restriction? 

		Finding answers to these questions are likely to illuminate your path, making your next steps clear and intentional.
