## FAQ

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
      title="Are your readings online or in-person?"
    >
    Both! I do online readings over zoom and usually do in-person readings in a cafe, park, or private residence. If you book an in-person reading, I will follow up with you to determine a location or let you know if I'm only available online.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    title="What if I don't know anything about astrology?"
  >
    I tailor each reading to your level of experience to make sure the information is accessible and useful. I also encourage clients to ask for clarifications when something needs to be re-explained, and I check in through the session to make sure I've communicated well.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    title="Can I bring a friend?"
  >
    You can bring a friend to your reading so long as they are quiet and let the reading naturally unfold. I may ask your friend to leave if I feel they are being disruptive, or if I think the reading would go more smoothly without them present. 
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    title="What if I need to cancel?"
  >
    Please respect my time and let me know if you can't make your appointment! I require 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling, and charge half of my standard rate for missed appointments.
